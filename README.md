# SocialProject

This was a project done by me to explore APIs and how I could use their responses in a website. The Twitter and Imgur API were used for this project. I did this project to understand how to write frontend and backend code. I will say it ended up being a success as I leared A LOT from this as I was inexperienced. 

The project gets a tweet from the user's Twitter and then finds a somewhat, not really, related image from Imgur. The results are then shown on the site. Note, not all the results are suitable for work. 

The code is all available in the 'master' branch.

Note: You will have to use your own Twitter and Imgur account for the full user experience. I would include mine but I prefer not having my tokens out in the public :)
